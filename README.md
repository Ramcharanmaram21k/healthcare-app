Tools/Libraries Used
-React: The core JavaScript library used to build the user interface.
-Node.js / npm: The JavaScript runtime and package manager used for development.
-Git: Version control system used to track changes and collaborate.
-Vercel: A cloud platform used for a fast and simple deployment of the application.
-react-icons: A library of popular icons to provide a professional look and feel.
-react-scripts: A package that provides the scripts for starting, building, and testing the React application.

Improvements with More Time:

-Backend Integration: Connect the app to a real backend API and a database to handle user authentication, store doctor schedules, and manage bookings dynamically.
-User Authentication: Implement a login system for both patients and doctors to manage their profiles and appointments securely.
-Notifications: Implement email or SMS notifications to confirm appointments or send reminders.
-Improved Search Functionality: Add filters for date, time, and location to provide more precise search results.


Challenges faced and solutions:

*Git & Deployment: Solved initial push errors by correcting Git configuration and branch naming. Fixed a build-blocking OpenSSL error by adding a NODE_OPTIONS environment variable on both the local machine and Vercel, leading to a successful live deployment.
*Project Structure: Overcame build failures by implementing a standard create-react-app folder structure and creating a correct package.json file.
*Styling & Data: Resolved issues with broken images and styling by moving all assets to a local public/images folder and applying highly specific CSS rules.
