### Improvements with More Time
* **Backend Integration:** Connect to a real API and database to manage appointments.
* **User Authentication:** Implement a login system for both patients and doctors.
* **Appointment Management:** Allow patients to view, edit, and cancel their upcoming appointments.
* **Advanced UI/UX:** Add a calendar view, more advanced filtering, and notifications.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions
* **Git & Deployment:** Fixed initial push errors and a critical build error on Vercel by setting `NODE_OPTIONS` as an environment variable.
* **Project Structure:** Overcame build failures by creating a `package.json` file and moving components into the standard `public/` and `src/` folders.
* **Styling & Data:** Resolved issues with broken images and unresponsive CSS by using local files and applying highly specific CSS rules.
